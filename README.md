# image_classification

**Overview**
This project focuses on building an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset that consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

**Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust CNN model capable of accurately classifying images into their respective categories. Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in various domains, including object recognition and autonomous vehicles.

**Technologies Used**
Python
TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for model evaluation
Kaggle Notebook


**Dataset**
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains the following classes:
Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, allowing for model training and evaluation.
